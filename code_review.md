## Clean Code:
* relatively effective use of modular functions
* try to remove commented out code if it's deprecated

## Good Documentation:
* the workflow in the notebooks is very difficult to follow without markdown cells for explanation and analysis 
* comments are not particularly informative

## Proper Data Science:
* you seem to make a bunch of transformations to the data but ultimately don't seem to do much with them
* consider exploring more paramater configuarations for the various transformations 

## Comments:
* the makings of a cohesive project are here, but the analysis and application seem to lack direction
* having more clearly stated objectives may help guide better organization of workflow and notebooks
