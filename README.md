# Metis-Onl20-Ds4-What-s-Cooking
NLP Project

What's Cooking.

In this project, I used Natural Language Processing to analyze a Corpus of Recipe Titles and Recipe Ingredients.

1. What's Cooking.ipynb contains the majority of the analysis on the recipe titles. In this notebook, as preprocessing, we lowercased all tokens, 
removed stopwords, and removed punctuation. NLP algorithms used include K-Means clustering, NMF, Latent Dirchlet Analyisis, and Word 2 Vec. LDA analysis that 
presented involved using t-sne. 

2. What's Cooking-Ingredient Analysis.ipynb contains analysis on the recipe ingredients. In this workbook we converted the list of ingredients into strings,
removed the word 'ADVERTISEMENT', stopwords, and punctuation. 

3. The Presentation File is the format used to present to findings to the Metis Bootcamp on 11/13/2020.
